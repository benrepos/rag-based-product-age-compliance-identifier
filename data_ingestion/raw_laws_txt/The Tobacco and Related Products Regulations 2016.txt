Directive 2001/31/EC  of the European Parliament and Council of 8 June 2000 on certain
legal aspects of information society service, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal
Market (“the e-commerce directive”) in relation to electronic cigarette advertising.
These regulations revoke and replace the Tobacco for Oral Use (Safety) Regulations 1992 (SI
1992/3134) and the Tobacco Products (Manufacture, Presentation and Sale) (Safety) Regulations
2002 (SI 2002/3041) as amended by SI 2007/2473, which implemented Directive 2001/37/EC
of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2001 on the approximation of the laws,
regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture,
presentation and sale of tobacco products, the precursor to the Tobacco Products Directive.
Part 2 deals with the labelling of tobacco products. Regulation 5 requires tobacco products for
smoking to carry a health warning label including a colour photograph on the front and back
surfaces and regulations 7 and 8 require a general warning and information message on other
surfaces. Regulation 9 makes special provision for the labelling of large cigars and individually
wrapped cigars and regulation 10 for the labelling of smokeless tobacco products. Images of
tobacco products targeted at consumers must comply with regulation 12.
Part 3 deals with emissions and additives. Regulation 13 sets maximum tar, nicotine and carbon
dioxide levels for cigarettes. Regulation 15 prohibits cigarettes and hand rolling tobacco with a
characterising flavour, although it does not apply to menthol cigarettes until 20th May 2020 (see
regulation 56(3)). Regulation 16 prohibits the use of certain additives and regulation 17 prohibits
tobacco for oral use.
Part 4 deals with reporting of information about tobacco products. Producers of tobacco
products are required to submit ingredients information (regulation 19), emissions information
(regulation 20), sales data and market research information (regulation 21) to the Secretary of
State. Novel tobacco products are to be notified to the Secretary of State in accordance with
regulation 22 to 24. Regulation 27 prohibits a producer who has failed to comply with reporting
obligations from supplying the product concerned.
Part 5 deals with herbal products for smoking. Regulation 28 requires herbal products for
smoking to carry a health warning label and regulation 29 requires producers to report ingredients
information.
Part 6 deals with electronic cigarettes. Producers of electronic cigarettes and refill containers
are required by regulations 31 and 32 to submit product information, sales and other data to the
Secretary of State. Regulation 36 sets out product requirements for electronic cigarettes and refill
containers including maximum nicotine concentration. Electronic cigarettes are required to be
labelled and presented in accordance with regulations 37 and 38. Regulation 39 sets out vigilance
requirements including actions to be taken where an electronic cigarette or refill container is
believed to be unsafe and the Secretary of State may take appropriate provisional measures under
regulation 40 to address serious risks to human health.
Part 7 deals with electronic cigarette advertising. Regulations 42 and 43 prohibit electronic
cigarette advertising in the press and information society services (“ISS”) subject to limited
exceptions. ISS are regulated on a “country of origin” basis in accordance with the e-commerce
directive. Regulation 44 prohibits electronic cigarette sponsorship of cross-border events.
Regulations 45 and 46 amend the Communications Act 2003 to prohibit electronic cigarette
advertising, sponsorship and product placement on-demand television and electronic cigarette
product placement on broadcast television. (Electronic cigarette advertising and sponsorship on
broadcast television and radio is prohibited by means of amendments to the OFCOM Broadcasting
Code and the UK Code of Broadcast Advertising.)
Part 8 (regulation 47) places requirements on retailers engaging in cross-border distance sales to
consumers.
Part 9 deals with penalties, enforcement and defences. Part 10 contains transitional provisions,
savings provisions and revocations.
Regulation 58 requires the Secretary of State to review the operation and effect of these
Regulations and publish a report within five years after they come into force and within every five
years after that. Following a review it will fall to the Secretary of State to consider whether the
61

Changes to legislation: There are currently no known outstanding effects for the The

Regulations should remain as they are, or be revoked or be amended. A further instrument would
be needed to revoke the Regulations or to amend them.
An impact assessment of the effect that these Regulations will have on the costs of business and
the voluntary sector has been prepared. As these Regulations transpose a Directive, a transposition
note setting out how the Government has transposed the Directive into UK law has been prepared.
Copies of the impact assessment and the transposition note have been placed in the libraries
of both Houses of Parliament and are also annexed to the Explanatory Memorandum which
is available alongside the instrument on the www.legislation.gov.uk website. Copies of the
International Standards referred to in this instrument are available for purchase on line from
