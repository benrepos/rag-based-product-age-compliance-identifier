Policy: Compressed gases (butane, CO2) â€” 18+
Source type: policy
Jurisdiction: UK (ecommerce)
Effective date: 2025-10-22
Review date: 2026-04-01
Owner: Compliance

Rule:
- All compressed gas cylinders and bottles are 18+ for online sale and delivery.
- Examples (non-exhaustive): CO2 bottle, CO2 cylinder, dispense gas, Argon/CO2 mix, disposable butane gas bottle, gas cylinder, gas canister, compressed gas.

Rationale:
- Aligns with Trading Standards/retailer guidance and common delivery partner requirements to prevent under-18 access where statute is silent or fragmented.
- Treats compressed gases consistently with other age-restricted product handling in ecommerce.

Synonyms (for retrieval/matching):
- "co2 bottle", "co2 cylinder", "dispense gas", "argon/co2 mix", "disposable butane gas bottle", "butane gas bottle", "gas cylinder", "gas canister", "compressed gas", "600g co2", "sodastream cylinder".

Exceptions / notes:
- Cigarette lighter refills containing butane are already legally 18+ under The Cigarette Lighter Refill (Safety) Regulations 1999; this policy reaffirms but does not replace that statute.
- Where local laws impose stricter rules, obey the strictest requirement.
