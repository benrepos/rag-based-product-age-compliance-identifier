In some cases, goods cannot be supplied to anyone below a certain age. These laws exist to safeguard \nthe health of young people. We \nneed to be aware of the legal age at which different rights or responsibilities apply . Discussion should include: \n• Why we have laws to protect younger people. • Why your rights and responsibilities change as you get \nolder (so that you can do more and more is expected  of you). • Are any of the laws outdated and should they be scrapped or changed. • Why shopkeepers ask for ‘proof of age’? • Why ‘proof of age’ cards are useful to all age groups. Consider travelling by trains, boats and planes, cinema entry, festivals, purchase of some videos and computer games, lottery tickets/scratch cards and night club entry. Some facts:\n• It is illegal to buy alcohol if you are under 18. You can \nbe stopped, fined or arrested by the Police if you are under 18 and drinking alcohol in public. The police can confiscate the alcohol. The person who sells the alcohol to you can get a criminal record and be fined up to £5,000. • It is a crime if somebody who is over 18 buys alcohol for a person who is under 18 years old. This is called ‘proxy \npurchasing’ . They can receive an £80 on the spot fine or \nface prosecution with a fine up to £5,000. • If you work in a shop, you cannot sell alcohol if you are under 18.• Challenge 25. A shopkeeper should refuse to sell age restricted products to anyone who appears to be under the age of 25 years old and does not have an acceptable form of photo identification (ID), like a PASS card. A shopkeeper can be fined for selling age-restricted products to people who are under age. • PASS cards have a distinctive PASS logo in the hologram. The table below shows what age you have to be to legally buy certain things.

DVDs, videos, video and computer games: Classification 1212 or overAGE RESTRICTED PRODUCTS\nLegislation prohibits the sale, supply, \noffer to supply, or hire of specified products to persons under the minimum legal age. There are age restrictions (under the age of 18) applicable to tobacco products, offensive weapons (knives and similar), crossbows, adult fireworks, solvents, airguns, lighter refills containing butane, and alcohol. There are age restrictions (under the \nage of 16) applicable to low-hazard low-noise fireworks (party poppers and similar products), lottery tickets, and aerosol paint. The age restriction for Christmas crackers is 12. There are different age restrictions on videos, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs (collectively referred to here as ‘video recordings’ - 12 and over, 15 and over, and 18 and over) and video games (12 and over, 16 and over, and 18 and over). Legislation also provides \nrequirements for certain warnings and notices to be displayed when selling particular products. Traders should always ask young \npeople to produce proof of their age, such as the national Proof of Age Standards Scheme (PASS) card, a photocard driving licence or a passport. TOBACCO\nThis area is covered by the Children and Young Persons (Protection from Tobacco) Act 1991, the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, and the Protection from Tobacco (Sales from Vending Machines) (England) Regulations 2010. Under this legislation, it is an offence \nfor any person to sell cigarettes, tobacco products or cigarette papers to anyone under 18 years of age, even if they look older. This is the case whether or not the cigarettes are for the young person’s own use. It is also an offence to sell cigarettes unless they are in quantities of ten or more and in their original packaging. This means that packets of cigarettes cannot be split to sell lesser quantities. ILLEGAL TOBACCO\nIllegal tobacco is usually fake products, smuggled genuine products or brands specifically made for the illegal tobacco market. Young people are being offered \nillegal tobacco more than adults, making it easier for them to smoke. Dealers see underage smokers as easy targets. Illegal tobacco has strong links with \ncrime and criminal gangs, so many of the people smuggling, distributing and selling it are involved in drug dealing, money laundering, people trafficking and even terrorism. Additionally, fake cigarettes often \nprove to contain substances that make it even more dangerous than regular tobacco, and criminals avoid paying duty on smuggled imports.Research shows that illegal tobacco:• Encourages children to start \nsmoking\n• Prevents adult smokers from giving \nup\n• Brings organised crime into our communities\nSelling illegal tobacco is a crime. Crimestoppers\nCall 0800 555111 for anonymous \npublic reporting. 5TABLE OF PENALTIES FOR SELLERS OF PRODUCTS TO PERSONS UNDER CERTAIN AGES\nThe following table, showing penalties for selling, supplying, offering to supply and hiring (as appropriate to the \nlegislation) products to persons under certain ages. These penalties are in place to protect young people and a good reason to stop shops selling to those underage.",

(See end of Document for details)\nDirective 2001/31/EC  of the European Parliament and Council of 8 June 2000 on certain\nlegal aspects of information society service, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal\nMarket (“the e-commerce directive”) in relation to electronic cigarette advertising. These regulations revoke and replace the Tobacco for Oral Use (Safety) Regulations 1992 (SI\n1992/3134) and the Tobacco Products (Manufacture, Presentation and Sale) (Safety) Regulations\n2002 (SI 2002/3041) as amended by SI 2007/2473, which implemented Directive 2001/37/EC\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2001 on the approximation of the laws,\nregulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture,\npresentation and sale of tobacco products, the precursor to the Tobacco Products Directive. Part 2 deals with the labelling of tobacco products. Regulation 5 requires tobacco products for\nsmoking to carry a health warning label including a colour photograph on the front and back\nsurfaces and regulations 7 and 8 require a general warning and information message on other\nsurfaces. Regulation 9 makes special provision for the labelling of large cigars and individually\nwrapped cigars and regulation 10 for the labelling of smokeless tobacco products. Images of\ntobacco products targeted at consumers must comply with regulation 12. Part 3 deals with emissions and additives. Regulation 13 sets maximum tar, nicotine and carbon\ndioxide levels for cigarettes. Regulation 15 prohibits cigarettes and hand rolling tobacco with a\ncharacterising flavour, although it does not apply to menthol cigarettes until 20th May 2020 (see\nregulation 56(3)). Regulation 16 prohibits the use of certain additives and regulation 17 prohibits\ntobacco for oral use. Part 4 deals with reporting of information about tobacco products. Producers of tobacco\nproducts are required to submit ingredients information (regulation 19), emissions information\n(regulation 20), sales data and market research information (regulation 21) to the Secretary of\nState. Novel tobacco products are to be notified to the Secretary of State in accordance with\nregulation 22 to 24. Regulation 27 prohibits a producer who has failed to comply with reporting\nobligations from supplying the product concerned. Part 5 deals with herbal products for smoking. Regulation 28 requires herbal products for\nsmoking to carry a health warning label and regulation 29 requires producers to report ingredients\ninformation. Part 6 deals with electronic cigarettes. Producers of electronic cigarettes and refill containers\nare required by regulations 31 and 32 to submit product information, sales and other data to the\nSecretary of State. Regulation 36 sets out product requirements for electronic cigarettes and refill\ncontainers including maximum nicotine concentration. Electronic cigarettes are required to be\nlabelled and presented in accordance with regulations 37 and 38.

Rationale:\n- Aligns with Trading Standards/retailer guidance and common delivery partner requirements to prevent under-18 access where statute is silent or fragmented.\n- Treats compressed gases consistently with other age-restricted product handling in ecommerce. Synonyms (for retrieval/matching):\n- \"co2 bottle\", \"co2 cylinder\", \"dispense gas\", \"argon/co2 mix\", \"disposable butane gas bottle\", \"butane gas bottle\", \"gas cylinder\", \"gas canister\", \"compressed gas\", \"600g co2\", \"sodastream cylinder\". Exceptions / notes:\n- Cigarette lighter refills containing butane are already legally 18+ under The Cigarette Lighter Refill (Safety) Regulations 1999; this policy reaffirms but does not replace that statute.\n- Where local laws impose stricter rules, obey the strictest requirement. Citations / Links (guidance/policy references):\n- Association of Convenience Stores (ACS) guidance on age-restricted sales (retrieval copy ingested in this system)\n- Trading Standards retailer advice (local authority publications)\n- Delivery partner age-verification requirements (e.g., ID on delivery) Provenance:\n- This is a company policy to be applied where the retrieved law does not explicitly cover the product type.\n- Include this policy in evidence when determining ecommerce age restrictions for compressed gases.",

However, it is recommended that retailers voluntarily age restrict these substances for those \nunder 18, to prevent those at highest risk from gaining access to those products. It is an offence to supply where the \nretailer knows whether the psychoactive substance is likely to be consumed for its psychoactive effects. There is no \nexpectation for a retailer to go above and beyond what is reasonable and the offences only apply where there is a \nlikelihood of consumption.

If you see the adult asking the \nchild what alcohol they want, or if \nthe child’s behaviour suggests the \nalcohol is for them – then you should \nrefuse the sale. If you fear for your safety, you \nshould try to remove yourself from \nthe situation or call for help. If \nyou receive abuse or threatening \nbehaviour, make sure you report it \nto your manager. For more advice \non dealing with violence and abuse \nvisit: www.acs.org.uk/advice    \nTry, as far as possible, to monitor \nwhat is happening outside your \nstore, especially, if young people \nare hanging around. If you see what \nlooks like an adult being asked to \nbuy a product by a person outside \nthe store, refuse the sale to that \nperson and report it to the police. ACS recommends the use of Challenge 25 policies for all age restricted sales. Challenge 25 is a store policy based on two simple principles: \n1. All staff serving customers should be trained to ‘think 25’. This  \nmeans if a customer is seeking to buy an age restricted product  \n(of any kind), the staff member should ask themselves the  \nquestion – ‘does the person in front of me look like they might be \nunder the age of 25 years?’ If the answer is yes, then they should ask \nthe person for a valid proof of age. If the identification confirms they \nare over the legal age of purchase for that  \nproduct, then it can be sold to them. 2. The store policy is clearly communicated to customers, usually \nthrough the use of visible in-store signage. Posters, shelf labels, badges and other materials are  \navailable to download and print from  \nhttp:/ /www.challenge25.org/downloads.htmlChallenge 25Avoiding conflict\nCommon refusal approaches  \nIt is normal for retailers and staff to feel apprehensive or \nawkward about asking people to prove their age. However \nthis is something that they must overcome, and initial \nconcerns are best dealt with through developing strategies \nfor approaching the issue that suit the individual. Also, it is worth bearing in mind, that whilst it feels \nawkward for staff, it is actually something that young \npeople are very accustomed to and the vast majority \nexpect to be asked. Here are the most common \napproaches you can use: Proxy sales  \nIt is offence for an adult to purchase alcohol, tobacco  \nor nicotine inhaling products on behalf of someone \nunder age. This is commonly called a ‘proxy sale’. You should consider adopting a common approach  \nto identifying and preventing proxy sales across all age \nrestricted products.It can be very difficult to know if an adult intends to buy \nan age restricted product for or on behalf of someone \nwho is underage. Therefore, you are only expected to act \nwhen an obvious proxy sale is taking place.",

ID checklist\nThe Government recommends that military ID cards can \nbe used as proof of age. Guidance on how to identify \nthese cards, including examples of British Army, Royal \nNavy and Royal Air Force ID cards was published in the \nHome Office False ID guidance in July 2012. There are a \nnumber of different cards and so understanding what is, \nand is not, a legitimate card can be confusing. If you trade near a military base, or have a large number \nof service personnel as customers, then we recommend \nyou should familiarise yourself with the types of military \nID used in your area. There are separate ID cards for  \neach of the armed forces (army, navy and air force). Military ID cards are held by all serving personnel, \nincluding 16 and 17 year olds, so you must check the \ndetails on the card, including date of birth and expiry \ndate. There is no requirement for these cards to  \nbe signed.Military ID \nYou may have customers that seek to prove their age with \nnon-UK passports or National Identity Cards. You can \nexpect that all EU and most other international passports \nwill carry the following distinguishing features: \n•  paper that does not reflect ultraviolet light or whose  \nfluorescence is easily distinguishable from the blue used \nin commonly available fluorescent materials;\n• watermarking on the biographical data and visa pages;\n•  an intricate, repetitive pattern as the background design \non each page;\n•  a background design on the biographical data page \nthat is different to the design(s) on other pages in the \npassport;\n• ultra-violet fluorescent ink on the biographical  \n data page. If you have suspicions about the validity of any foreign \npassport or ID card you can refuse the sale, but UK \nequality legislation requires that you do not impose a \npolicy of refusing all foreign passports or identity cards.Other foreign ID  \nFor age restricted products excluding alcohol , there are \nadditional ways that customers can provide proof of their \nID digitally. You can accept digital forms of ID under the \nfollowing circumstances:Digital ID\n• The purchase does not include alcohol. •  The method of digital verification that is used is one \nthat you understand how to use and is part of an age \nverification system that has been implemented in  \nyour business. •  Digital ID  must comply with Pass 5: 2021 Requirements \nfor Digital Presentation of proof of age.3.

Any training must reflect this. •  Examples of acceptable documentation are   \navailable on page 6. •  Check for security features on a driving licence, such \nas raised text and an image that changes when the \ncard is tilted to ensure it is genuine. Only accept cards \nthat  have the expected security features. CHECK THE PASS HOLOGRAM \n(IF NOT A PASSPORT OR DRIVING LICENCE)\n•  Look for the 3D effect in the background of the \nhologram. •  Make sure it has the characteristic tick on the ‘A’ in the \nPASS lettering. •  The hologram must be flush with the plastic of the card \n– NOT stuck on top of the plastic.

The primary purpose of the \nlegislation is to stop the sale of items that are commonly \nknown as ‘legal highs’. However, the Act will also have \nimplications for legitimate retailers, which in many cases \nwill sell psychoactive substances such as butane and \nsolvents entirely legitimately. If you choose to provide a delivery service for goods that are sold online, you typically have three options for doing \nso. You can take control of the entire process, work with a delivery-only partner or work with an established delivery \nand ordering platform such as Deliveroo or Uber Eats. For the sale of age restricted products, ID checks must be \ncarried out before any goods are delivered to a customer. Where retailers are in control of the ordering process, they \nare responsible for checking the ID of the customer before a delivery. Established delivery and ordering platforms, \nsuch as Deliveroo or Uber Eats may take on the responsibility for age verifications checks as part of the terms and \nconditions of their contract with you. You must check the details of this before any transactions are made, ensuring \nyou have clearly in writing who is responsible for the age verification checks. The below processes do not apply to the online sales of bladed articles, bladed products, and corrosive substances. Specific ACS guidance that covers the online sales processes of these items is available at acs.org.uk/advice\nUnder the new rules, a psychoactive substance is defined \nas one which affects a person’s mental functioning \nor emotional state by stimulating or depressing their \nnervous system.In practice, this would include the kind \nof effect that we associate with controlled drugs, such as \nhallucinations, changes in alertness, perception of time \nand space, mood or empathy with others and drowsiness.

This is fine, as long as you can generate reports \nif you have an inspection. A refusals register must be regularly reviewed by you or \nother management employed in your business. You should \nassess the register for evidence of:Your refusals register\n• Days and times when refusals appear to not be  \n taking place. •  Staff members that appear to not be refusing  \n   (or recording refusals). •  If you notice anything unusual about the pattern of \nrefusals recorded you should investigate to find the \ncause.
